**ft\_linear\_regression**
A simple implementation of linear regression to predict car prices based on mileage.

**Description:**
This project introduces the fundamentals of machine learning by implementing a basic linear regression model trained with gradient descent. The program learns from a dataset of car prices and mileage, then predicts prices for new mileage values.

**Features:**

* Training program to compute model parameters (θ₀, θ₁) using gradient descent
* Prediction program to estimate car prices based on mileage
* Saves and reuses trained parameters for future predictions
* Bonus: Data visualization and precision evaluation

**Tech stack:** Python, standard libraries only
